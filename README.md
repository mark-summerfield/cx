# cx

cx is a C library aiming to provide basic collections & conveniences to
“complete” the standard library so that I can use C more easily.

This is a personal project for self-education. It is _neither_ commercial
_nor_ open source. The only reason this repo is “public” is for when I ask
for help with bugs!
